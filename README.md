# CarEvaluationXGBoost
This project focuses on comparing the performance of machine learning model training on CPU versus GPU using the Car Evaluation dataset from Kaggle. The dataset consists entirely of categorical features that describe different characteristics of a car, and the target is to classify each car into one of four acceptability classes.
