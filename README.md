# CarEvaluationXGBoost
This project focuses on comparing the performance of machine learning model training on CPU versus GPU using the Car Evaluation dataset from Kaggle. The dataset consists entirely of categorical features that describe different characteristics of a car, and the target is to classify each car into one of four acceptability classes.

Project Title:
CPU vs GPU Performance Comparison Using XGBoost on Car Evaluation Dataset

Student Name(s):

Problem Statement:
Training machine learning models on large datasets using CPUs can be time-consuming due to sequential execution. This project compares CPU and GPU performance for training a machine learning model using the Car Evaluation dataset. The goal is to analyze the impact of GPU-based parallel computation on training time while maintaining high classification accuracy.
